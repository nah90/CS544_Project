# Dataset Description

This dataset was created from information regarding meteorite landings over hundreds of years. Meteorites are
extraplanetary objects that have breached earth's atmosphere. As they breach the atmosphere, they leave
behind glowing trails of matter and are often mistakenly referred to as 'shooting stars'. The meteor may or may
not collide into Earth's surface, creating an impact crater. The dataset consists of meteorite names (based on location),
recorded class, mass in grams, whether it fell or was found, year of occurrence, recorded latitude, and recorded longitude.

# Project Objective

The objective of the class project is to analyze the data contained within the dataset for the purpose of informing
the reader. This is done by examining both categorical and numerical variables, looking at the distribution of the data,
applying the Central Limit Theorem, and performing various sampling method techniques.

# Data Preparation

As seen by the image below, there are multiple levels of classification for meteorites. At the highest level,
meteorites can be divided into being Undifferentiated or Differentiated. The majority of the meteorites are
Undifferentiated meteorites. Undifferentiated Meteorites themselves can be divided into four categories:
Carbonaceous, Ordinary, Rumuruti (R), and Enstatite. Of these categories, the majority are Ordinary meteorites,
which can be further divided into the categories: H Meteorite, L Meteorite, and LL Meteorite. The data will be wrangled
to meet the need to examine the data across these three levels of classification.


![Image Source: Clipartkey - Meteorite Classification Chart.](Meteor_Type.png)

Using tidyverse, new columns will be created from the original column 'recclass' representing each meteorite's
classification for each of the three levels. Meteorites that are not in a particular subclass will have an N/A
value for that respective column. Then, a final column, 'Lowest_Class', will be created that shows each meteorite's
lowest classification level.

###Data Preparation
old_meteor <- as_tibble(read.csv("C:\\Users\\Nathan\\Documents\\Grad School\\CS 544 Summer 01 2021\\project\\Meteorite-Landings.csv"))
meteor <- old_meteor ##preserve original tibble
undiff.list <- unique(c(meteor[str_detect(as.matrix(meteor$recclass),c('^C|^E|^H|^L|[0-9]|OC')),]$recclass)) ##list of Undiff meteors with stringr
undiff.list <- undiff.list[str_detect(undiff.list,c('ite|Lunar|achon'),negate=TRUE)] #take out any Diff meteors with stringr

l.list <- l.list[str_detect(l.list,c('^LL'),negate=TRUE)]
meteor <- meteor %>% ##tidyverse mutate for new columns
  mutate(Differentiated=sapply(meteor$recclass, differentiateMeteor),
    Undiff_Type=sapply(meteor$recclass, undifferentiateType),
    Ordinary_Type=sapply(meteor$recclass, ordinaryType),

meteor <- meteor %>%
  mutate(year=format(as.Date(meteor$year, '%m/%d/%Y'), '%Y')) ##change date format to year

```

# Variable Exploration Analysis

## Barplots of Frequency by Year

The dataset includes information from the year the meteorite crashed through to Earth.
A barplot of year by frequency shows this data in a concise way. The y-axis
is logarithmically scaled to provide a cleaner plot.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
###Analysis
##Barplots of Frequency by Year
year.freq <- data.frame(table(meteor$Year)) ##df of meteor frequency by year
plot_ly(x=year.freq$Var1, y=year.freq$Freq, name='Frequency of Meteorites by Year', type='bar') %>%
  layout(yaxis= list(title='Frequency',type='log'), xaxis=list(title='Year'), ##plot
         title='Logarithmic Scaling of Meteorites Per Year') -> year.barp ##log scale
year.barp
```

A stacked barplot breaking down the meteorites by type into a lower classification level
provides a viewer with insight into trends of meteorite landings.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
d.year.freq <- data.frame(table(meteor$Year[meteor$Differentiated == 'Differentiated'])) ##form freq dfs
c.year.freq <- data.frame(table(meteor$Year[meteor$Undiff_Type == 'Carbonaceous']))
o.year.freq <- data.frame(table(meteor$Year[meteor$Undiff_Type == 'Ordinary']))
r.year.freq <- data.frame(table(meteor$Year[meteor$Undiff_Type == 'Rumuruti (R)']))
e.year.freq <- data.frame(table(meteor$Year[meteor$Undiff_Type == 'Enstatite']))
plot_ly(x=d.year.freq$Var1, y=d.year.freq$Freq, name = 'Differentiated', type="bar") %>% ##plot
  add_trace(x=c.year.freq$Var1, y=c.year.freq$Freq, name = 'Carbonaceous') %>%
  add_trace(x=o.year.freq$Var1, y=o.year.freq$Freq, name = 'Ordinary') %>%
  add_trace(x=r.year.freq$Var1, y=r.year.freq$Freq, name = 'Rumuruti (R)') %>%
  add_trace(x=e.year.freq$Var1, y=e.year.freq$Freq, name = 'Enstatite') %>%
  layout(yaxis = list(title='Frequency', type='log'), xaxis=list(categoryorder ='ascending', ##log scale
         categoryarray =year.freq$Var1,title='Year'), ##titles
         title='Logarithmic Scaling of Meteorite Type By Year',
         barmode='stack') -> year.sbarp ##stack barmode
year.sbarp
```

Further breaking down Ordinary meteorites to their lowest type reveals more trends. Of note, the years
with the largest frequency spikes seem to correlate with a high number of  LL type meteorites.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
h.year.freq <- data.frame(table(meteor$Year[meteor$Ordinary_Type == 'H Meteorite'])) ##form freq dfs
l.year.freq <- data.frame(table(meteor$Year[meteor$Ordinary_Type == 'L Meteorite']))
ll.year.freq <- data.frame(table(meteor$Year[meteor$Ordinary_Type == 'LL Meteorite']))
plot_ly(x=h.year.freq$Var1, y=h.year.freq$Freq, name = 'H Meteorite', type="bar") %>% ##plot
  add_trace(x=l.year.freq$Var1, y=l.year.freq$Freq, name = 'L Meteorite') %>%
  add_trace(x=ll.year.freq$Var1, y=ll.year.freq$Freq, name = 'LL Meteorite') %>%
  layout(yaxis = list(title='Frequency', type='log'), xaxis=list(categoryorder ='ascending', ##log scale
         categoryarray =year.freq$Var1,title='Year'), ##titles
         title='Logarithmic Scaling of Meteorite Type By Year',
         barmode='stack') -> oyear.sbarp
oyear.sbarp
```

## Histograms of Probability Fell vs Found

The dataset also includes whether the landed meteorite fell or was found. A histogram
breaking down probability of 'Fell' vs 'Found' across classification levels provides
insight with regard to which is more likely dependent on classification.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
##Histograms of Probability Fell vs Found
plot_ly(meteor, x=~Fell_Status, color=~Differentiated, histnorm='probability') %>% ##plot
  layout(title='Probability Breakdown of Fell Status For All Meteorites',
         yaxis=list(title='Probability')) %>%
  add_histogram()
```

Further lowering the classification groupings, the following is a breakdown of 'Fell' vs
'Found' across all Undifferentiated meteorites by types Carbonaceous, Enstatite, Ordinary,
and Rumuruti (R).


```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot_ly(meteor, x=~Fell_Status, color=~Undiff_Type, histnorm='probability') %>% ##plot
  layout(title='Probability Breakdown of Fell Status For Undifferentiated Meteorites',
         yaxis=list(title='Probability')) %>%
  add_histogram()
```

Lastly, this histogram examines 'Fell' vs 'Found' of Ordinary type meteorites. While
L type meteorites had an almost even split with regard to 'Fell' vs 'Found', LL
type meteorites were heavily found as opposed to fell. Almost 90% of LL type meteorites
were found after impact rather than seen falling.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot_ly(meteor, x=~Fell_Status, color=~Ordinary_Type, histnorm='probability') %>% ##plot
  layout(title='Probability Breakdown of Fell Status For Ordinary Meteorites',
         yaxis=list(title='Probability')) %>%
  add_histogram()
```

## Pie Charts of Type of Fell vs Found

These two pie charts break down the percentages of lowest classification level for meteorites
dependent on whether they fell or were found. Of note, LL type meteorites are only the fourth highest
share of the pie for 'Fell', while they are the highest slice for 'Found'.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
##Pie Charts of Type of Fell vs Found
meteor.fell <- filter(meteor, Fell_Status=='Fell') ##tidyverse to filter by 'Fell_Status'
dcount.fell <- meteor.fell %>% count(Differentiated) ##tidyverse to filter Diff
udcount.fell <- meteor.fell %>% count(Undiff_Type) ##tidyverse to filter Undiff
ocount.fell <- meteor.fell %>% count(Ordinary_Type) ##tidyverse to filter Ordinary type
pie.values.fell <- as.numeric(c(dcount.fell[1,2],udcount.fell[1,2],udcount.fell[2,2],udcount.fell[4,2],
  ocount.fell[1,2],ocount.fell[2,2],ocount.fell[3,2])) ##grab values for pie chart
plot_ly(meteor.fell, labels= c('Differentiated','Carbonaceous','Enstatite','Rumuruti (R)',
        'H Meteorite','L Meteorite','LL Meteorite'), values= pie.values.fell, type='pie') %>% ##plot
  layout(title='Pie Chart of Meteorite Type Breakdown By Having Fell') -> fell.pie
fell.pie

meteor.found <- filter(meteor, Fell_Status=='Found') ##tidyverse to filter by 'Fell_Status'
dcount.found <- meteor.found %>% count(Differentiated) ##tidyverse to filter Diff
udcount.found <- meteor.found %>% count(Undiff_Type) ##tidyverse to filter Undiff
ocount.found <- meteor.found %>% count(Ordinary_Type) ##tidyverse to filter Ordinary type
pie.values.found <- as.numeric(c(dcount.found[1,2],udcount.found[1,2],udcount.found[2,2],udcount.found[4,2],
  ocount.found[1,2],ocount.found[2,2],ocount.found[3,2]))
plot_ly(meteor.found, labels= c('Differentiated','Carbonaceous','Enstatite','Rumuruti (R)',
  'H Meteorite','L Meteorite','LL Meteorite'), values= pie.values.found, type='pie') %>% ##plot
  layout(title='Pie Chart of Meteorite Type Breakdown By Having Been Found') -> found.pie
found.pie
```

## Boxplots of Mass by Meteorite Type

The dataset also includes recorded mass of meteorites in grams. The boxplots below,
with one examining all meteorites and the next two highest classification levels and the
other examining Ordinary type meteorites and their respective classification, show the associated
five number summary with respect to mass as well as outliers. The y-axis is logarithmically scaled to
provide a cleaner view of the data, given that the vast majority of meteorites are on the smaller end
with regard to mass, with a number of very significant outliers. Two interesting points within the first
boxplot are the higher Q1, Median, and Q3 values for Differentiated Mass compared to Undifferentiated Mass
and that the largest meteorite by mass, with a multitude greater than five times heavier
than the second heaviest meteorite, is a Differentiated meteorite.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
##Boxplots of Mass by Meteorite Type
plot_ly(y = meteor$Mass, type="box", name = 'All Mass') %>% ##plot
  add_trace(y = meteor$Mass[meteor$Differentiated == 'Undifferentiated'], name = 'Undifferentiated Mass') %>% ##add traces
  add_trace(y = meteor$Mass[meteor$Differentiated == 'Differentiated'], name = 'Differentiated Mass') %>%
  add_trace(y = meteor$Mass[meteor$Undiff_Type == 'Carbonaceous'], name = 'Carbonaceous Mass') %>%
  add_trace(y = meteor$Mass[meteor$Undiff_Type == 'Ordinary'], name = 'Ordinary Mass') %>%
  add_trace(y = meteor$Mass[meteor$Undiff_Type == 'Rumuruti (R)'], name = 'Rumuruti (R) Mass') %>%
  add_trace(y = meteor$Mass[meteor$Undiff_Type == 'Enstatite'], name = 'Enstatite Mass') %>%
  layout(yaxis = list(title='Mass (g)',type = 'log'), title='Logarithmic Scaling of Meteorite Mass') -> mass.boxp ##log scale
mass.boxp
```

Two aspects that stand out with regard to the second boxplot are the drastically smaller Q1, Median,
and Q3 values for LL type meteorites when compared to other types of Ordinary meteorites or Ordinary
meteorites as a whole. A second point of observation is that the two largest meteorites by mass are
H type meteorites, both significantly heavier than the heaviest L type or LL type meteorite.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot_ly(y = meteor$Mass[meteor$Undiff_Type == 'Ordinary'], type="box", name = 'Ordinary Mass') %>% ##plot
  add_trace(y = meteor$Mass[meteor$Ordinary_Type == 'H Meteorite'], name = 'H Meteorite Mass') %>% ##add traces
  add_trace(y = meteor$Mass[meteor$Ordinary_Type == 'L Meteorite'], name = 'L Meteorite Mass') %>%
  add_trace(y = meteor$Mass[meteor$Ordinary_Type == 'LL Meteorite'], name = 'LL Meteorite Mass') %>%
  layout(yaxis = list(title='Mass (g)',type = 'log'), title='Logarithmic Scaling of Meteorite Mass') -> omass.boxp ##log scale
omass.boxp
```

## Scatterplots of Mass and Year by Meteorite Type
A scatterplot displaying the different mass values for each meteorite by year provides a colorful
way to examine the mass of meteorites by year grouped by lowest classification type. The first scatterplot
shows the mass for each meteorite, logarithmically scaled, broken down by type, per year.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
##Scatterplots of Mass and Year by Meteorite Type
plot_ly(data=meteor, x=~Year, y=~Mass, color=~Lowest_Class, type='scatter', mode='markers') %>% ##plot
  layout(yaxis=list(type='log'), title= 'Mass of Meteorites Per Year By Type')-> mass.plot
mass.plot
```

The next scatterplot shows the aggregated maximum mass across types per year. It is interesting to note
a general downward trend exists for Enstatite type meteorites. Considering the relative rarity of the
Enstatite type, this is a strong indicator that modern technology is capable of identifying much smaller
meteorites than technology of generations past.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
maxmass=aggregate(x=meteor[c('Mass')], by=meteor[c('Year','Lowest_Class')], FUN=max, na.rm= TRUE) ##plot
plot_ly(data=maxmass, x=~Year, y=~Mass, color=~Lowest_Class, type='scatter', mode='markers') %>%
  layout(yaxis=list(type='log'), title= 'Maximum Meteorite Mass Per Year By Type')-> maxmass.plot
maxmass.plot
```

This scatterplot shows the aggregated minimum mass across types per year. There appears to be
a slight downward trend in the data. As mentioned previously, this is most likely an indication
of human advancement in detecting even the smallest meteorites.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
minmass=aggregate(x=meteor[c('Mass')], by=meteor[c('Year','Lowest_Class')], FUN=min, na.rm= TRUE) ##plot
plot_ly(data=minmass, x=~Year, y=~Mass, color=~Lowest_Class, type='scatter', mode='markers') %>%
  layout(yaxis=list(type='log'), title= 'Minimum Meteorite Mass Per Year By Type')-> minmass.plot
minmass.plot
```

This graph shows a scatterplot of aggregated mean across multiple meteorite types broken down by year.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
avgmass=aggregate(x=meteor[c('Mass')], by=meteor[c('Year','Lowest_Class')], FUN=mean, na.rm= TRUE) ##plot
plot_ly(data=avgmass, x=~Year, y=~Mass, color=~Lowest_Class, type='scatter', mode='markers') %>%
  layout(yaxis=list(type='log'), title= 'Average Meteorite Mass Per Year By Type')-> avgmass.plot
avgmass.plot
```


Lastly, this scatterplot shows the aggregated standard deviation of mass across meteorite types
by year. A point of interest is that prior to 1914, only one year had recordings of two or more
LL type meteorites.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
stddevmass=aggregate(x=meteor[c('Mass')], by=meteor[c('Year','Lowest_Class')], FUN=sd, na.rm= TRUE) ##plot
plot_ly(data=stddevmass, x=~Year, y=~Mass, color=~Lowest_Class, type='scatter', mode='markers') %>%
  layout(yaxis=list(type='log'), title= 'Standard Deviation of Meteorite Mass Per Year By Type')-> stddevmass.plot
stddevmass.plot
```

## Bar Chart of Mean and Median Mass by Meteorite Type

This bar chart shows the mean and median mass of each lowest classification type.
The y-axis is logarithmically scaled. Data is said to be skewed right if the mean is
greater than the median while data is said to be skewed left if the mean is less
than the median. For all types except Rumuruti (R), the mean is vastly greater than the median
which implies a heavy skew right.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
##Bar Chart of Mean and Median Mass by Meteorite Type
meanmass.type=aggregate(x=meteor[c('Mass')], by=meteor[c('Lowest_Class')], FUN=mean, na.rm=TRUE) ##mean aggregate
medianmass.type=aggregate(x=meteor[c('Mass')], by=meteor[c('Lowest_Class')], FUN=median, na.rm=TRUE)
plot_ly(x=meanmass.type$Lowest_Class, y =meanmass.type$Mass, type = 'bar', name = 'Mean') %>% ##plot
  add_trace(x=meanmass.type$Lowest_Class, y =medianmass.type$Mass, name= 'Median') %>%
  layout(yaxis = list(title = 'Mass (g)', type= 'log'), barmode = 'group') -> meanmedian.bar ##log scale
meanmedian.bar
```

## Density Curve of Mass by Meteorite Type

The below density curve shows a density curve of mass, logarithmically scaled, broken down
across lowest level classification. While there are only five Rumuruti (R) meteorite type
data points in the dataset, it is interesting to note the shape of that curve as well as
the curves for LL type meteorite and H type meteorite compared to the other density curves.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
##Density Curve of Mass by Meteorite Type
mmasslc <- meteor[c('Mass','Lowest_Class')] ##new tibble
ggplot(mmasslc, aes(Mass, fill= Lowest_Class)) + geom_density(alpha=0.25) -> masscurve.scatter ##create in ggplot
masscurve.scatter <- ggplotly(masscurve.scatter+scale_x_continuous(trans= 'log10')+ylab('Density') ##move plot to plotly
    +xlab('Mass (g)')+ggtitle('Density Curve of Mass With Logarithmic Scale Per Type') ##title
    +theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)))
masscurve.scatter
```

## Map of Meteorite Coordinates by Type

The dataset also includes recorded latitude and longitude for each meteorite landing. The following map displays
all meteorite impact locations color-coded by lowest classification level and size scaled by mass. Hovering over
a data point on the map displays the name of the meteorite, the mass, and the year of impact- coded by color.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
##Map of Meteorite Coordinates by Type
plot_mapbox(meteor) %>% ##map
  add_markers(x=~Rec_Long, y=~Rec_Lat, size=~Mass, color=~Lowest_Class, text=~paste('Name:',Name,'- Mass:',Mass,'grams - Year:',Year),
  hoverinfo='text', marker=list(sizeref=0.25)) ##size scaled by 4
```

## Distribution of Mass

The following two histograms demonstrate the distribution of the mass variable of all meteorites
with a recorded mass value. Both graphs show that the data is heavily skewed to the right, with a
huge number of outliers including a single massive outlier. The following probability histogram
demonstrates this.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
##Distribution of Mass
plot_ly(x=meteor$Mass, type='histogram', histnorm='probability') %>% ##plot
  layout(title='Distribution of Meteoric Mass', yaxis=list(type='log',title='Probability'), ##log scale
  xaxis=list(title='Mass (g)')) -> massdist.hist
massdist.hist
```

The second of the two histograms shows density and is logarithmically scaled to provide a
clearer view of the curve. It is interesting to note that while density peaks around 10 grams,
it is not a smooth path down the curve to the x-axis. There is a significant upward bump
in density around 1000 grams which leads to a temporary increase in density before falling once again.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data.frame(meteor), aes(x=meteor$Mass)) + geom_density(alpha=0.5) -> massdistlog.hist ##create in ggplot
massdistlog.hist <- ggplotly(massdistlog.hist+scale_x_continuous(trans= 'log10')+ylab('Density') ##move plot to plotly
    +xlab('Mass (g)')+ggtitle('Density Curve of Mass With Logarithmic Scale')
    +theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)))
massdistlog.hist
```

# Application of Central Limit Theorem

The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of sample means taken independently
from a population are normally distributed even if the population itself does not follow
a normal distribution. The sample means will also match the population mean. Furthermore,
the theorem states that the standard deviation of a sample is equal to the standard deviation
of the population divided by the square root of the associated sample size. In the following example,
the mean and standard deviations for samples of size 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, and 150 will be analyzed.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
##Central Limit Theorem
mmass <- meteor$Mass ##mass
samples <- 1000 #number of samples
xbar <- numeric(samples) ##xbar list
for (size in c(25,50,75,100,125,150)) { #loop through sample to populate xbar
  for (i in 1:samples) {
    xbar[i] <- mean(sample(mmass, size, replace = FALSE), na.rm=TRUE) ##xbar
  }
  
  ggplot(data.frame(xbar), aes(x=xbar)) + geom_density(alpha=0.5) -> loop.hist ##create in ggplot
  loop.hist <- ggplotly(loop.hist+scale_x_continuous(trans= 'log10')+ylab('Density') ##move plot to plotly
                               +xlab('Average Mass (g)')+ggtitle(paste("Sample Size =",size,
                                'With Logarithmic Scale'))
                               +theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)))
  
  cat("Sample Size = ", size, " Mean = ", mean(xbar), ##print statement of mean/sd
      " SD = ", sd(xbar), "\n")
  
  print(loop.hist) ##display each plot
  
}
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
paste('Population Mean: ', round(mean(mmass, na.rm=TRUE),2)) ##pop mean
paste('Population SD: ', round(sd(mmass, na.rm=TRUE),2)) ##pop sd
paste('CLM Estimate given Sample Size of',c(25,50,75,100,125,150), 'is:', round(sd(mmass, na.rm=TRUE)/sqrt(c(25,50,75,100,125,150)),2)) ##check sample sd vs sqrt values
```

The complete distribution table among lowest classification levels for the population is below.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
##Sampling Methods
sample.size=125 ##sample size
round(table(meteor$Lowest_Class)/nrow(meteor),2) ##pop distribution by lowest classification type
```

## Simple Random Sampling Without Replacement Distribution Table

Below is the distribution table broken down by lowest classification level created with
simple random sampling without replacement, utilizing a sample size of 125.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Simple Random Sampling Without Replacement
mass.srswor <- srswor(sample.size,nrow(meteor)) ##srs without replacement
df.msrswor <- meteor[mass.srswor !=0,] ##new df
table(df.msrswor$Lowest_Class)/sample.size ##df table
```

## Systematic Sampling Distribution Table

This table shows the distribution of count by lowest classification level with sample size 125,
from the use of systematic sampling.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Systematic Sampling
meteor.nrow <- nrow(meteor)
meteor.ss <- sample.size
meteor.ceiling <- ceiling(meteor.nrow/meteor.ss) ##ceiling for systematic sampling
meteor.r <- sample(meteor.ceiling,1) ##r value
mass.ss <- seq(meteor.r, by=meteor.ceiling, length=meteor.ss)
df.mss <- meteor[mass.ss,] #new df
table(df.mss$Lowest_Class)/sample.size ##df table
```

## Systematic Sampling With Unequal Probabilities Distribution Table

The following table shows the distribution of count by lowest classification level created
with systematic sampling with unequal probabilities, with a weight on mass. A sample size
of 125 was used.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Systematic Sampling With Unequal Probabilities
meteor.pik <- inclusionprobabilities(meteor$Mass, sample.size) ##pik, weighted by Mass
mass.upss <- UPsystematic(meteor.pik)
df.mupss <- meteor[mass.upss!=0,] ##new df
table(df.mupss$Lowest_Class)/sample.size ##df table
```

## Stratified Sampling Distribution Table

The last distribution table is broken down by lowest classification level and was created
using stratified sampling, with a sample size of 125.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Stratified Sampling
meteor.nonone <- meteor %>% filter(Lowest_Class != 'Rumuruti (R)') ##filter out Rumuruti (R) as low value count can cause errors
meteor.nonone <- #meteor.nonone %>% filter(Lowest_Class != 'Enstatite')
meteor.strat <- meteor.nonone[order(meteor.nonone$Lowest_Class),]
mass.strat <- strata(meteor.strat, stratanames=c('Lowest_Class'),size=c(table(meteor.nonone$Lowest_Class)/nrow(meteor.nonone)*sample.size), method='srswor')
df.mstrat <- getdata(meteor.strat, mass.strat) ##df strat sampling
table(df.mstrat$Lowest_Class) ##df table
```

## Comparison of Various Sample Means and Population Mean

Comparing the population mean against the various sample means, the closest mean came from the
stratified sampling mean. This mean was significantly larger than the population mean. The mean
from systematic sampling with unequal probabilities was drastically higher, which makes sense
given the huge rightward skew of the data by mass and the fact that inclusion was weighted by mass. Lastly,
the mean from simple random sampling and systematic sampling was lower than the population mean.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
paste('Mean of Data from',c('Simple Random Sampling Without Replacement','Systematic Sampling',
    'Systematic Sampling with Unequal Probabilities', 'Stratified Sampling', 'Population'), 'is:', ##paste
    round(c(mean(df.msrswor$Mass, na.rm=TRUE),mean(df.mss$Mass, na.rm=TRUE),mean(df.mupss$Mass, na.rm=TRUE),
      mean(df.mstrat$Mass, na.rm=TRUE),mean(meteor$Mass, na.rm=TRUE)),2)) ##mean
